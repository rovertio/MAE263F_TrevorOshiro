# MAE263F_TrevorOshiro
Repository for code and files written for the MAE263F class at UCLA. 

### Homework 1 Submission:
All code and report files are contained within the Homework1 file in this repository. Each of the files for problems are made to be run within the same Homework1 folder, as the folder contains helper functions necessary for the execution. Plots for each of the problems are generated through running each of the python scripts within the folder. Specific execution instructions are given below:
- Problem1.py script requires uncommenting execuations of the main function seen towards the bottom of the code, which gives different plots for implicit and explicit methods within the beam simulation. For the twist angle plot, adjustments would have to be manually made with the radius variables (R1, R2, R3) found at towards the top of the script. 
- Problem2.py can be run without adjustments for the problem
- Problem3.py would need adjustments from the user to implement various time values for the first part of the problem. Further adjustment would then be needed with the P variable for force, where lines would be uncommented within the script to simulate the load application to a beam
